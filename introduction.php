        Are you ready to have more fun and enjoyment in life? Are you looking to have a more fulfilling life? If these are some of your hopes and desires, your involvement and use of the BeWelI’r System will allow you to reach what you are striving to achieve! “The BeWell’r System is unique, instead of providing volumes of fitness and wellness facts and encouraging the individual to just do it...this program connects the facts to the action. “It is an easy to use system that helps people implement wellness concepts into their daily lives” commented a former participant. Results of people who have learned how to more effectively manage their life discovered that the life they desired was now within their reach -— You can have the life you want!
        <br /><br />
        A healthy lifestyle is the most potent means we have to promote health, but it is something each individual must develop for him or herself. The BeWell’r System will help you improve your health by pointing you in the right direction and by helping you teach yourself better lifestyle management skills. The BeWell’r System is not just a stress management, nutrition counseling, weight management, fitness, or personal growth program. Instead of counting calories or attempting unrealistic behaviors, you learn to manage all your lifestyle choices without reliance on costly outside “expert” advice, programs, or products. You will become the expert by using the suggestions, checklists, and charts to get quick, accurate, personal information and feedback about YOUR lifestyle. The charts are used to indicate daily recommended levels of behaviors that lead to health enhancement. Please keep in mind, each step taken toward a healthier lifestyle helps even if ideal behavior may not be possible immediately. Healthier behavior, in any form, dramatically improves your chances of good health and well-being.
        <br /><br/ >
        Use of the BeWelI’r System will not make you behave healthier but it will help use your own initiative to analyze and build on your strengths to make healthier lifestyle choices. In a short time (4 weeks), you will teach yourself how to manage your lifestyle in a healthier manner through personal knowledge and self-responsibility. Remember, never consider the time you spend working on or thinking about
        yourself as selfish; everybody will get the benefit of a healthier, happier, more self-confident and productive you if you spend just 5 to 15 minutes a day on yourself using the Becker BeWell’r System©. A better life is within everyone’s reach and this program can help you take the steps needed for improved happiness and health!
