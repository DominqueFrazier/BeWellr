      <p>Although "The BeWellr System©" was developed from research ﬁndings, health facts, theories, and studies, the main thrust and input for the program comes from Craig Becker's real life experiences. Craig was with three friends the night of September 21st, 1984, after a high school football game
    dance. The car in which they were riding collided head on with another one. His three friends died at the
    scene; the driver and the passenger in the other car survived.<br /><br /> When Craig came out of a coma six and a half days later at Porter Memorial Hospital, he couldn't walk (the left side of his body was paralyzed), talk, or stand and didn't recognize his parents or remember the accident. In fact, he remembers little of what happened during the month preceding or after the accident. "I didn't learn about the accident until around Halloween that year,” says Craig, who received his BS in accounting from Purdue University in May. 1989. Within a month of the accident, Craig had improved enough to be transferred to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. His mother took the train to Chicago every afternoon to visit him after therapy. His dad joined them daily after his job as superintendent of the cold-sheet mill at Bethlehem Steel, Bums Harbor, Indiana. Both parents worked tirelessly with their son, teaching him how to do simple things over again. He had to learn to read, add, subtract, and tie his shoes. "The hospital would let us take Craig out at night, and we'd go to a restaurant and work math problems," recalls John Becker. "We didn't have to push him—he pushed us."<br /><br /> By the ﬁrst week of December, Craig was back in
    school but frustrated that he had to take high school algebra rather than the calculus he had been enrolled in at Valparaiso University before the accident. "He was trying so hard to be as good (in school and everything) as he ever was," Sharon Becker says of her son, who, until the accident, had been ﬁrst academically in his high school class. Craig ended up graduating fourth in his class. Craig’s athletic skills came back more quickly than his academic abilities. An All-American swimmer before the accident, he was able to compete in the Indiana state ﬁnals in February, I985, finishing 15th in the 50-yard freestyle and marking his best time ever. Craig says the doctors credited his overall quick recovery to his excellent physical and mental condition before the accident and to the fact that his family was close by and kept in constant contact. "The accident really brought us a lot closer," he says, referring to not only his parents but also his sisters Holly and Jill. "We were a close family before this happened, and we developed a different kind of closeness because of it," explains Sharon Becker. "It‘s pretty well known that accidents like this either bond a close family even more or pull a not-so—close family
    apart.” Because of her work in his recovery, Craig nominated his mom that spring for the Super Mom
    Award given by the city of Valparaiso, and she won. "Really both my parents should have won a Super
    Parents Award," remarks Craig.<br /><br /> An elementary school teacher before Craig's accident, Sharon Becker says working with Craig led her to become a learning disabilities teacher. Before the accident, Craig had applied to Purdue and was accepted. Doctors and his parents suggested taking a light load of classes his freshman year, but he refused. Even though there is a happy ending, Craig hit a low point during his sophomore year. He almost dropped out of school, but stayed with encouragement from his parents. Craig explains that he learned much from his parents’ positive perspective. He said, "My parents kept reminding me that each little success. No matter how small, was a step in the right direction and
    would help me lead a happier life. They told me to build on each success and to never take for granted the positive steps Intake, even the small ones." As Craig continued to grow, he attended Ball
    State University's Institute for Wellness, where he earned his MS in Wellness Management. "Wellness
    is an exciting ﬁeld and I feel I have a lot to contribute" explained Craig. Craig, says that he and his wonderful wife Camilla, are very happy.<br /><br /> Craig and Camilla were married December27, 1992. They met at Ball State University when she was an exchange student from Sweden. Following her semester as an exchange student, she returned to Sweden for one semester to earn her degree in elementary education. After she earned her degree in Sweden, she returned to America for, a Master’s degree in education from Ball State University. Upon reﬂection, Craig does not attribute his drive and determination to recover from the accident as an effort to "stay alive," but, and he emphasizes, "to
    improve the quality of my life. I'm not done; I will always look for new and better ways to improve the
    quality of my life!"
