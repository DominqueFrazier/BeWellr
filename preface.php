        Congratulations! You have taken your first step toward increased happiness and health! This program, The BeWell’r System© will help you find your pathway to positive health -- individual Effort is your key to success. This program will not make you well’r, but it will help you be successful. This effective program was designed for the sole purpose of helping you independently take control of your life and health. Understand, there is not only one way to use this system, you decide how to get the best results for a better life.<br /><br /> A True health care system would not only treat us when we are sick, but it would make sure we know how to maintain and continually improve our health. While healthcare reform may or may not take place, we can reform our lifestyles. A healthier lifestyle is the most powerful means we have to improve our life, increase life satisfaction, and have higher levels of joy, energy, vitality, and confidence. Health is
        more than the absence of disease, health is positive and we should be focusing on moving toward gains beyond a simple state of “unsickness.” Disease prevention will be the natural complimentary by-product of a better life. We can take control and improve our health and well-being by taking control of our behaviors.<br /><br /> Some programs advise adherence to a single health habit or they will recommend that we must behave in a specified pattern, eat certain foods, exercise in a prescribed way, or cope with our problems in a preconceived manner. Research and common sense tell us that good health does not result from adherence to a single health habit but from the cumulative effects of multiple health habits. Objective personal lifestyle information and feedback about your lifestyle is needed to develop healthier
        behavior. Using the BeWell’r System’s© suggestions, checklists, and charts for about 10 minutes a day provides you the information you need to create a healthier lifestyle. As you use the BeWell’r System© you will be educated about desirable lifestyle choices. It is recommended that you only use the BeWell’r System© for 4 weeks to create new habits. If, however, you undergo significant life changes such as a new job, new baby, marriage, or other altering event, it would be beneficial for you to use this system again so you can teach yourself how to live healthy with your new circumstances.<br /><br /> Most importantly, you will learn how to permanently take control and continually improve your life, health, and happiness. As you do this, not only will you be healthier and prevent more disease, you also will be building a healthier environment.
